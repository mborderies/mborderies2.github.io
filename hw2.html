		<p> I think that Berger is really well spoken, and although he makes everything very easily digestible, his insights are super interesting. The first episode brought up the idea of the context of art, and how photography essentially led to the globalization of art (changing the location and accessibility of it). He also talked about conservation, which was a little depressing to me. Later on, he compares a museum to a bank, and I think that's the perfect analogy. Art is seen as an investment, a profitable piece that holds one's wealth. I think the extent to which we treat it as a currency is really sad. I've heard of museums that display replicas and keep the actual piece hidden away so that it doesn't get damaged or lose it's value. Conservation is super important, but at what point does it cross the line from wanting to preserve history to wanting to keep your assets safe? Although art has been primarily a way to display wealth and social class, I think that at its core it should be for the world to see and appreciate. He also brought up how the context of a painting changes depending on what it's placed next to, specifically the Goya painting. I've seen plenty of advertisements that use classical art. I personally think it's a really smart and funny way to advertise - taking a culturally iconic image and using it to advertise something totally alien from the century it was made in. Below is an advertisement for a dating site that uses the Mona Lisa. </p>

		<p>I'm really interested in the psychological aspects of advertising and marketing, so I think my favorite episode was the 4th one. Berger was able to put into words the essence of advertising, which is something I struggle to do because it seems so ingrained in our culture. I particularly loved the comparison of elements of classical painting to modern advertisements, and the idea of 'you are what you have' was really intriguing. It really hasn't changed much since the 14th century - humans want material possessions to be above others. I think that advertising is slowly progressing from the style of alienation. Rather than advertisements being focused on an unattainable person, brands are slowly using more 'real' depictions of people. This is also true of social media advertisements. 10 years ago, the only people who got brand deals on social media were those with over 100,000 followers. Now, the phenomenon of the micro-influencer is very much real. People with smaller follow counts are still getting these deals because they are selling to people that they know - family members, friends, friends of friends, etc. Since consumers are a bit more aware of the 'scam' that advertising is, micro-influencers introduce this level of trust that you wouldn't get from a huge influencer. You're probably more likely to buy something from someone you know than an unattainable stranger online.</p>
