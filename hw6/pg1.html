          <p>The Architecture of Hip Hop</p>
          <p class="text">I thought the entire discussion of space, work and production was very interesting, especially when you consider how the genre of Hip Hop draws from many other products from different social spaces. Sampling in Hip Hop is extremely diverse, and so many artists sample music from all different backgrounds. The late MF DOOM would sample snippets from old superhero cartoons, Nas often samples Persian funk and Bollywood music, and many Hip Hop artists sample movies from different cultures (i.e. Wu Tang's use of dialogue from Chinese martial arts films, or Busta Rhyme's sample of Hitchcock's "Psycho" in the song Gimme Some More). The act of combining so many different cultures and influences together produces a completeley different social space, and it's very interesting to see. As said in the reading, I think that the technological aspects are very important in Hip Hop, but I don't think that it's necessarily the core element. Arguably the first modern Hip Hop song is Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang, and that song is simply the Sugarhill Gang rap group freestyling over a really long musical break that was originally part of a disco song. While I think that now, the importance of production and technological aspects are valued a lot higher, Hip Hop originated from poetry and spoken word, so I would argue that the lyricism and rhyme schemes are more important.</p>
