          <p>The Architecture of Hip Hop</p>
          <p class="text"> What really was most interesting to me throughout this whole piece was the idea of taking what Hip Hop represents, and manifesting that into a physical space. Wilkins' speaks about 'Hip Hop Park', and goes into detail on what materials would be used and why, and the layout and usage of each part. Each part has a meaning and I've never really thought about a tangible represenation of a genre before, but it makes a lot of sense.</p>
