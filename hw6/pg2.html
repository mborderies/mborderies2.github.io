          <p>The Architecture of Hip Hop</p>
          <p class="text">While most of Hip Hop music speaks on issues that Black people face in America, I think it also has provided an outlet for other oppressed people across the world. In Mathieu Kossovit's 1995 movie La Haine, teenagers in Parisian suburbs use Hip Hop music as a way to express their frustrations against the brutality of the police. In one part of the movie, they sample KRS-One's "Sound of da Police", which shows how permeating and expressive the genre really is. Again, this is an example of a social space emerging from this genre - people from completely different parts of the world can share their frustrations and use music almost as a coping mechanism</p>
