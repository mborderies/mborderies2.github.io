			<p> Week 1 Homework</p>
			<p> Madeleine Borderies</p>
			<p> As We May Think</p>
			<p>I think my biggest realization while reading this piece was the vital aspects that you need in order for a technological advancement to mean anything. Firstly, I think communication methods are essentially as important as the message they are trying to communicate. Berners-Lee talks about this a little, what good is the greatest scientific discovery of the century if it doesn't reach the right audience?</p>

			<p> Expanding on that, I think aesthetic accessibility and usability is so important. When the first computers came around, it wasn't a widespread product. They were very primitive and you needed to know how to code to use them, so the general public had no interest in them. When the Graphic User Interface came around with Mac, and made everything more visually pleasing and easier to use, that's when they really took off. So, it's not only physical communication that needs to happen, but visual communication as well. Again, what good is arguably one of the greatest inventions of this century if the majority of the population can't even use it? 
			</p>
			<p> Lastly, the success of a technological advancement is heavily reliant on timing, and whether or not the world is ready for the advancement. The article brings up Leibnitz's calculating device, and how similar it was to more modern keyboard devices, however it was ahead of its time. This also makes me think of how people often say that the telephone was a step backwards and away from progress. The telegraph used technology much more similar to digital modern communication devices, whereas the telephone used an analog system. However, when the telegraph came around, we were pretty far away from any sort of web or internet world. It was just interesting to see how there have been so many missed connections in the world of technology, and how someone so long ago could fathom the basic building blocks of a technology that we use regularly today. 
			</p>
			<p> Long Live the Web </p>
			<p> I think the concept of the Web is very interesting if you look at it through the lens of human nature. Like Berners-Lee brought up, there are now many threats to privacy, security, and fairness, from individuals, companies, and government entities alike. I think of it kind of as a social experiment - in the same vein as "Lord of the Flies" ; if you leave humans to their own devices with complete freedom, what will they do? Eventually they destroy each other, especially when they are handed so much power and information with little regulation. In my opinion, it was always bound to happen. Although I certainly don't think that the Web is 'dead', I do think that it was always destined to be corrupted and misused.
			</p>
			<p> When speaking about the 'walled garden' business style, I think the only company that has succeeded and will continue to succeed is Apple. They continue to have a loyal fan base, and while I think aesthetics and status symbols have a lot to do with that, Apple is honestly pretty good quality, or as good as any computer. I had a MacBook for many years, and it eventually broke (to be fair it was a high school hand me down from my sister, so it was 13 years old). I purchased a Dell, thinking that the quality would be better, especially since I often use applications like the Adobe Suite which require a lot of processing power. I should have just gotten a Macbook, because this computer is only two years old and it's already breaking down. I think Apple draws people in with their sleek designs and cultural relevance, but people tend to stay because it's so much more user friendly and honestly stands the test of time.
