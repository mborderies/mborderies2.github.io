			<p> In a similar vein as 'net art', a lot of fashion brands have been increasingly presenting their work in an online space. GCDS displayed their SS 2021 runway collection through a virtual show, where the models and clothes were all animated using CGI. They even included celebrities in the audience that would have attended the real show - Dua Lipa, Gigi Hadid, and other A listers. This was such a cool way to adapt to the restrictions put on by covid, and it also allowed for a more fantastical representation of the clothes. The animated models were otherworldly, which gave a different aspect to the work that wouldn't have been achieved by a simple runway show. The online show can be easily accessed by anyone, and it was broadcasted live on GCDS's social media handles, which helps eliminate this aspect of exclusivity that is so heavily present in the fashion world. Additionally, brands like Tribute are emerging, which sell clothing exclusively in a digital space. This means you never actually receive a physical garment, you purchase a virtual piece of clothing, and submit photos that you want edited, and the company uses their 3D software to place the clothing item on the photo. Again, there's an aspect of 'otherworldliness', of being able to show off clothing online that would be unrealistic as a physical garment. It's just interesting to see how the pandemic has really advanced this entire category of art and fashion that wasn't as big beforehand. Continuing on the point of accessibility, I think net art opens doors for so many more people to consume and create art. In our class, we're doing everything open source, and that's kind of the gist of the whole internet - almost everything is open access. I think it's really interesting especially when you mix the internet with something like the art world, which has been historically very exclusive and closed off. </p>
